This is a very light weigth linux distro that can can be run on 70MB of ram.It is made by compiling the latest linux kernel.

To download the iso file head ove to the "Realeses" section

Feel free to use the os and let me know what can be improved.

The rootfs was made using buildroot.

<h2><u>HOW TO USE</u></h2>

IF YOU ARE USING VIRTUALBOX ATTATCH THE ISO TO THE CD/DVD ROM DRIVE ON YOUR VM.

NEXT , WHEN THE GRUB MENU SHOWS UP,SELECT THE CD ROM OPTION.

WAIT FOR THE BOOT PROCESS TO COMPLETE

WHEN THE "BUILDROOT LOGIN " PROMPT APPEARS, LOGIN AS ROOT AND NO PASSWORD.

Have fun!! ;)
